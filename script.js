//Tonight you will be demonstrating your ability to work with values, types, and operators. Create a new HTML document and link an external JavaScript file to it. Inside the JavaScript file, use console.log(...) to write out the result of the following operations:

//8 * null = ???
console.log(8 * null)

//“5” - 1 = ???
console.log("5" - 1)

//“5” + 1 = ???
console.log("5" + 1)

//“five” * 2 = ???
console.log("five" * 2)

//false == 0 = ???
console.log(false == 0)

//5 > 2 && 6 > 3 = ???
console.log(5 > 2 && 6 > 3);
